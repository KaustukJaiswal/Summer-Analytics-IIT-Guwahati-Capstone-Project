# DYNAMIC PRICING FOR URBAN PARKING LOTS
# What's the problem?
-Urban areas often face parking crisis.

-Some parking lots are always overcrowded while other remain empty, even when nearby.

# Why?
-Because parking prices are static.

-That is they don't change based on:

-How full a lot is

-How heavy the traffic is

-What type of vehicle is trying to enter

-If it's holiday or event day

# What's the goal?
Building an AI-powered dynamic pricing system that updates parking fees in real time for each of 14 parking lots so that:

-Prices increases when demand is high

-Prices drop to attract drivers when demand is low

-This system learns from real- world patterns

-Based on real-time data:

-Prices adjust every 30 minutes

-Starting from a base price of $10.

-This makes parking smarter, fair, and better utilized.
